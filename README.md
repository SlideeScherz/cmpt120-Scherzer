# Intro to programming

Archived!\
This repository contains coding projects I wrote during my undergrad at Marist college. Note THIS CODE IS VERY ELEMANTARY. This is an archived repository and I have not altered any source code to maintain its inregrity for when it was written. This repositories only purpose is to be a sort of time capsule for me to look back and enjoy my struggles and triumpths as an early developer

## Course Objectives:

- Introduce a disciplined approach to problem-solving methods and algorithm development;
- Teach program design, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation using good programming style;
- Learn a high-level programming language;
- Provide familiarity with computer hardware and software technology;
- Provide a foundation for further studies in computer science.
- This course also has a required lab component. The labs are synchronized with and
  supplement the lecture material through hands-on problem-solving and programming exercises.

## Target Outcome

- Understand and explain basic computer science concepts such as von Neumann architecture
  (execution, memory, I/O), binary and byte codes, computer networks,
  and the interpreter

- Create and use variables, data types, and operator
- Use structured program constructs such as conditionals, loops, and functions
- Use elementary object-oriented principles of object and method design
- Understand and employ various fundamental objects such as Number, String, and Array
- Recognize and employ “good coding style”; e. g., comments, spacing and indentation,
  mnemonic variable names
- Effectively use the Python language and modern Web browser for both testing and debugging
