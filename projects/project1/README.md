If statements
(due 2/05/2020)

Write a Python program that gets two variables from the user, creates a third variable,
assigns the addition of the first two variables into the third variable, and uses
Python conditional (if) statements to derive and write out characteristics
about the values.

1. Open the Python Shell

2. Select file ‘New File’, and type in Python statements to complete the following steps

3. Get two integer values from the user, and assign into two variables. You can pick the names.

Mine looks like:

```py
variableOne = int( input( "Enter first number:" ) )
variableTwo = int( input( "Enter second number:" ) )
```

4. Assign the addition of the these two variables into a third ‘result’ variable

5. If the result of two numbers added together is 0 the output should indicate “result is zero”.

6. If the two numbers added together are less than 0 the output should indicate “result is negative”

7. If the two numbers added together are greater than or equal to 100 output should indicate “result is more than 99”

8. If the two numbers are the same numbers, the program should output “The numbers are equal”

9. Your program should use print statements to generate output to the Python Shell

10. Save your program (File menu, and Save As to select where to save your file)

11. Run your program (Run Menu, and “Run Module”)
