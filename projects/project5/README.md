# Project 5

Calendar\
due (4/22/2019)

Develop a Python program that will generate a representation of a one month calendar.

## Requirements:

1. Get user input for which day of the week (0-6, or 1-7) the
   calendar should start on.

2. Get user input for how many days are in the month (28-31).

3. The body of the calendar should be generated with nested loops to
   generate boxes that represent each day of the month.The boxes should be in
   a grid pattern (7 across, 4-6 down). The minimum width of the interior of
   the box should be 3 characters, the minimum height should be 2 rows.

4. Each box that represents a day should have the number of that day inside the box.(Boxes that donâ€™t represent calendar days should be empty).

5. Since this project is intended to reinforce looping and conditional processing,
   the output can be generated via text output via the

   ```py
   print( "*", end="'")
   ```

For example the boxes can be generated with the hyphen, pipe and space characters.

New lines can be generated with

```py
print()
```

Output for a calendar that starts on 5th (0 based) or 6th (1 based) day and has 28 days might look something like:
